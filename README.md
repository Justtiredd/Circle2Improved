# Circle2improved
a program that finds the diameter of a circle using the x, the y, and the radius that is provided within

CHANGES
- changed the name of the variables from x, y to xAxis and yAxis in order to differentiate it from the other x and y
- added @param statements to document each function
- edited the comments to sound clear for what we were supposed to do


## Resouces
- The HelloWorld project for @param statements
- the doc section of HelloWorld in order to write the README for this program
- used Circle1.java to help me further understand the workings of this code
